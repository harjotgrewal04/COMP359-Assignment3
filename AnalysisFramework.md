# **Analysis Framework**
## **1. Algorithm Design Choices**
### **1.1 Language Selection**
- For both the bottom up & top down approach python was used
- Easier to visualize
- Dynamic typing
- Readable
### **1.2 Knapsack Problem Approaches**
- Top-Down Approach: Memoization
- Bottom-Up Approach: Tabulation
- Memoization stores the results of functions calls so they do not have to be repeated and only the subproblems needed
- Tabulation finds and stores all of the results in a table until the problem is solved
